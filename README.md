# Movie-Recommendation-Project
This is a project I did towards the end of my internship training period under EI Systems Technologies in the data science course. 
This Model takes on data from 3 data sets and generates all the minimum desired output that one is looking for when they have their data enrolled into a recommendation system.
According to the users' past ratings on the movies he/she has watched this system recommends movies, and genres and also lists out the top 5 movies of those 3 top genres. Also, it works on Training and Testing aspects which is not exactly in the complete stage in all aspects.
